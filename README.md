# Description
The repository contains all the code I wrote and used while doing a course on computational physics. The library file contains the following sets of functions:
  1. Some input functions
  2. A random number generator
  3. Factorial calculator
  4. System of linear equations solvers
  5. Functions to determine the roots of a non-linear function
  6. Functions to evaluate integrals numerically
  7. ODE and PDE solvers
  8. Dominant eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvctor calculator
  9. Linear fitting and polynomial fitting functions
